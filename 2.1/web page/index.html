    <h1>PURPOSE OF COLLABORATIVE TOOLS</h1>
    <hr width="1030">
    <p>
     Collaboration tools are used in businesses and organizations for the following reasons:
     <h3> 1. For communication purposes</h3>
     Digital collaboration tools can be used for communication between team members. This is especially useful when the team
     members are located in different parts of the world.
     
     Collaboration tools allow communication through many mediums like instant messaging, voice-calling and also
     video-calling. There may also be other features to enhance communication.
     
       <h3> 2.To track progress of tasks</h3>
     Online collaboration tools allow groups to keep track of the progress in various tasks and projects. When all the team
     members know what the other members are up to, it increases transparency in the team. It also promotes accountability
     and responsibility in the team, thus increasing individual productivity and work efficiency.
     
      <h3>3. To share files and documents</h3>
     Collaboration tools can also be used to share files and documents with each other. Collaboration tools allow easier file
     access and file retrieval, thus saving employees a lot of time spent in looking for information. Thus, these tools can
     be useful in promoting productivity of employees in the tasks they are meant to do, while reducing the unnecessary
     workloads.
     
     <h3> 4. For hosting meetings</h3>
     Organizations can also host meetings through these online collaboration tools. These tools offer several versatile
     features that can make meetings a lot more efficient and productive. Organizations can also save a lot of money and
     effort that goes into conducting regular meetings for teams in the workplace.
     
      <h3> 5. For better team bonding</h3>
     Collaboration tools have also been proved to improve bonding between team members. Since the collaboration is done on a
     digital platform, it becomes highly useful for introverted team members who might not interact much otherwise. They also
     offer synchronous and asynchronous communication features which can further improve cohesion in the team.
     
     <h3>6.To make remote working easier </h3>
     Online collaboration tools can help in making the process of remote-working a lot smoother. Since remote working has
     become very popular, many teams are still finding it challenging to work together. Collaboration tools can be great
     solutions for remote working teams, helping them manage tasks and also come up with creative solutions in the process.
